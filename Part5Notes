/*  Configuration Vulnerabilities
 
   Problem: Leaving default settings in place can make it easier for an attacker to find an exploit, particularly if your
            application or framework is 3rd party and easy to obtain. Default logins and passwords are often found online:
                    http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/default-logins-and-passwords-for-networked-devices.html
                    
   Fix: Turn off default features you don't use to decrease attack surface. Change admin logins and passwords. 
   
   Problem: Debug features like Stack Trace and Status pages that should not be left in the production code. On Gruyere:
                http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/123/dump.gtl
            is included in the .gtl options but not referenced anywhere. It is a debug feature that allows database dump.
            
   Fix: Delete dump.gtl. Remove debug features if possible, otherwise lockdown by admin login and whitelisted IP address. In 
        case data is exposed, use password hashing: only cryptographic hash and salt value is stored, not actual password.
        
   Problem: Even if debug feature is removed, attacked can upload similar script of their own and run it.
   
   Fix: Ideally, only certain file types should be accepted for upload. Don't store user-uploaded files in same location as
        application files. Only allow files that are part of Gruyere to be treated as templates.
