/*
Problem: REFLECTED XSS attack, the attack is in the request itself (frequently the URL) and the vulnerability occurs when
the server inserts the attack in the response verbatim or incorrectly escaped or sanitized. The victim triggers the attack
by browsing to a malicious URL created by the attacker. In a stored XSS attack, the attacker stores the attack in the application
(e.g., in a snippet) and the victim triggers the attack by browsing to a page on the server that renders the attack, by not
properly escaping or sanitizing the stored data.

Example on Gruyere: http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/922914398469/flowers+%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Fix: Validate, Escape, Sanitize any untrusted user data
