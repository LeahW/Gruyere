Overview of potential Hardware vulnerabilities
Hardware Backdoors: Unspecified Don't Care conditions can create opportunities for unintentional or intentional (via foreign IP, 
  untrusted design tools, overseas foundries, unethical hardware engineers, or external compromise) access to restricted states.
  These can be avoided by specifying ever possible state, but creates overhead
Physical Security:
Side Channel Analysis:

Watermarking: Provide proof of authorship by embedding additional signature information. This can be done for Hardware IP by
   creating additional constraints out of Don't Care conditions that encode 0 or 1 bits. Challenge is to ensure equal performance
   (don't increase number of literals) while satisfying both the constraints required by system and by watermark signature.
   Public watermarks use a public signature, which helps transparency, but makes it too easy to change a few bits in the public
   watermark header. To properly validate, hash the bitstream file for the public signature and use this as the key to encrypt
   the hash and match to the public watermark body.
   
Integrated Circuit Metering: Security protocols that protect design house against (overseas) foundries overbuilding orders.
   Passive, non-functional example is imprinted and/or stickered PIN or serial number. 
   
Internal Unclonable Metering example: A functional scheme might use intrinsic variations that arise during the manufacturing process as an identifier. Additional flip-flops are introduced and used to 
   boost the Finite State Machine. This random value can be directed by a design house-controlled input sequence to reach the
   necessary initial state for functionality.
   
External Unclonable Active Metering example: A functional scheme might use additional control signals/logic (e.g. unneeded XOR)
   in non-critical parts of design. Each fabricate circuit is locked until it receives key from design house to unlock correct
   value for all control signals.
