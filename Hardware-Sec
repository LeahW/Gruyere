Overview of potential Hardware vulnerabilities
Hardware Backdoors: Unspecified Don't Care conditions can create opportunities for unintentional or intentional (via foreign IP, 
  untrusted design tools, overseas foundries, unethical hardware engineers, or external compromise) access to restricted states.
  These can be avoided by specifying ever possible state, but creates overhead
Physical Security:
Side Channel Analysis:

Watermarking: Provide proof of authorship by embedding additional signature information. This can be done for Hardware IP by
   creating additional constraints out of Don't Care conditions that encode 0 or 1 bits. Challenge is to ensure equal performance
   (don't increase number of literals) while satisfying both the constraints required by system and by watermark signature.
   Public watermarks use a public signature, which helps transparency, but makes it too easy to change a few bits in the public
   watermark header. To properly validate, hash the bitstream file for the public signature and use this as the key to encrypt
   the hash and match to the public watermark body.
   
Integrated Circuit Metering: Security protocols that protect design house against (overseas) foundries overbuilding orders.
   Passive, non-functional example is imprinted and/or stickered PIN or serial number. 
   
Internal Unclonable Metering example: A functional scheme might use intrinsic variations that arise during the manufacturing process as an identifier. Additional flip-flops are introduced and used to 
   boost the Finite State Machine. This random value can be directed by a design house-controlled input sequence to reach the
   necessary initial state for functionality.
   
External Unclonable Active Metering example: A functional scheme might use additional control signals/logic (e.g. unneeded XOR)
   in non-critical parts of design. Each fabricate circuit is locked until it receives key from design house to unlock correct
   value for all control signals. 
   
Hardware Physical Attack: requires access to chip or connection to signal wires / ability to measure target's signals, e.g.
    acoustic, RFID, and near-field communication, in addition to hardware, cryptographic algorithms, and data analysis
    Attacks are two-phased: Interaction (exploit a physical characteristic) and Exploitation (analyze the collected info)
    
Attackers:
  Class 1: Clever Outsiders. Smart, but limited access to system and limited access to equipment and tools
  Class 2: Knowledgeable Insiders. Has knowledge of system and access to equipment/tools.
  Class 3: Funded Organizations. Access to all resources, team of experts. Can invent new attacks to break target system.
  
Attack Goals:
  Theft of services provided by target, or money/payment info from target.
  Illegally Sell or Re-sell the product (IP piracy, overbuilding, cloning, counterfeiting)
  Interrupt or Denial-of-Service (give competitors an unfair edge)
  
  Attackers 'break' the system by gaining info they should not have (secret data or keys, system/chip/IP design info)
   this differs from cryptanalysis in method: not a mathematical analysis of theoretical weakness, but a physical attack
   that targets implementation of cryptographic encryptions. 
   
Attack Types: 
  Invasive Attacks: Direct access needed to chip/device. Hardware often damaged, so attack cannot be repeated and evidence of 
    tampering is often left behind. Typically high cost attack with advanced skill required.
  Non-invasive Attacks: Interact with device/chip via interface (voltage, current, clock, i/o, etc.) passive monitoring or
    active injection. Typically non-damaging, no evidence of tampering, and is low-cost and repeatable.
  Semi-invasive Attacks: Access to surface of the chip, but no contacts with internal wires. Normally does not damage
    equipment and may or may not leave tamper evidence. Moderate cost and skill required. Usually repeatable.
  
  Reverse Engineering: Invasive. Study chip structure and determin functionality by taking apart. Requires high cost,
    skill set similar to hardware designer, and capability similar to hardware manufacturer. 
  Micro-probing: Invasive. Requires direct access to chip surface to observe, manipulate, and interfere.
  Fault Genration: Semi- or Non-invasive. Run hardware in abnormal environments or use faulty input in hopes of causing 
    hardware to leak information or allow additional access.
  Side-channel Attack: Non-invasive. First, monitor/measure chip characteristics (power, current, timing, EM radiation, etc.)
    during normal operation. Second, perform data analysis to learn information.
  Software Attack: Non-invasive. Attacker uses normal input/output interface to exploit vulnerabilities in protocols, 
    algorithms, and software implementations. Repeatable. 
  Decapsulation/Deprocessing: Removing chip package, including multiple layers to expose silicon die and allow attackers to
    reverse engineer using optical microscope, digital camera to capture details of chip design and function at each layer.
  Depassivation/Microprobing: Expensive, high-tech equipment required. Can monitor on-chip bus activities down to the 
    submicron level without disturbing chip activities. Can also inject test signals and observe chip response. Secret keys
    and sensitive data can be extracted from memory using this method.
  Chip modification: Using design knowledge and silicon fabrication capabilities, attackers can rebuild or modify chip for 
    invasive attack, e.g. cutting internal connections to disable on-chip components such as encryption blocks. Cost varies.
  
Attack Tools:
  Invasive: Integrated Circuit soldering/desoldering station, simple chemical lab, high-res optical microscope, oscilloscope,
    logic analyser, signal generator, wire-bonding machine, laser-cutting system, microprobing station, scanning electron 
    microscope, FIB (focused ion beam) station.  Allows depacking of silicon chip and to make contacts with signals.
  Semi-invasive: all of above thru signal generator, plus UV light sources, lasers, microscopes for laser scanning and
    infrared, PC with data acqusition board, FPGA boards, prototyping boards.
  Non-invasive: Integrated Circuit soldering/desoldering station,oscilloscope, logic analyser, signal generator, PC with
    data acqusition board, FPGA boards, prototyping boards, digitial multimeter, Universal Programmer, IC tester,  and
    programmer power supplies
    
Examples:
  Imaging attack: With the help of cameras and photon probing, can read layout of chip, localize active regions and read 
    logical states of transistors. 
  Fault Injections: After locating security fues, attacker uses UV light to reset fuses to unprotected state. 
  Optical Fault Injection: Illumination of transistor can make it conduct and introduce transient fault or set value of a
    single bit in memory. Can be done with cheap laser pointers.
  Local Heating: Can permanently change memory cells
  Laser Pointers: Write into Static RAM or Memory Masking: disable Write operation in embedded fresh memory
  Side Channel Analysis: Laser can be pointed to certain transistor to collect power trace before and after using laser.
