Overview of potential Hardware vulnerabilities
Hardware Backdoors: Unspecified Don't Care conditions can create opportunities for unintentional or intentional (via foreign IP, 
  untrusted design tools, overseas foundries, unethical hardware engineers, or external compromise) access to restricted states.
  These can be avoided by specifying ever possible state, but creates overhead
Physical Security:
Side Channel Analysis:

Watermarking: Provide proof of authorship by embedding additional signature information. This can be done for Hardware IP by
  creating additional constraints out of Don't Care conditions that encode 0 or 1 bits. Challenge is to ensure equal performance
   (don't increase number of literals) while satisfying both the constraints required by system and by watermark signature.
   Public watermarks use a public signature, which helps transparency, but makes it too easy to change a few bits in the public
   watermark header. To properly validate, hash the bitstream file for the public signature and use this as the key to encrypt
   the hash and match to the public watermark body.
