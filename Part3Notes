/* Client-State Manipulation

 Problem: Elevation of Privilege
    The Edit Profile settings look at cookies to see if a login is an administrator. You can create a false cookie by visiting:
       http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/123/saveprofile?action=update&is_admin=True
    and then log out and back in to create a new cookie based on this browser history.
    Additonally, you can visit:
       http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/123/saveprofile?action=update&is_admin=True&uid=username
    to make ever user login an admin.
    
 Fix: Authorize access on the server-side at the time request is made. Don't leave it to the browser to toggle visibility.
