Prefer Public Encryption algorithm over proprietary. Non-peer reviewed ciphers are often reverse-engineered, broken by analysis

Symmetric Single Use Key: key is only used to encrypt one message (e.g. email)
Symmetric Multi Use Key: key is used to encrypt many messages (e.g. file system). Requires more work to be secure.
Digital Signature: Signature is a function of the content being signed, so attacker can't copy from one doc to the next
Secure Multi-Party Computation: Get the total result without revealing individual IDs. Examples: elections, private auctions
Private Outsource of Computation: Outsource a query/function of encrypted data and receive still-encrypted data back in return
Zero Knowledge: Ability to prove that you know the solution to a puzzle without actually disclosing details about that solution

Three Rigorous Steps in Cryptography (for each primitive):   
1. Precisely specify Threat Model (e.g. what can attacker do to attack digital signature? what would his goals be?)
2. Propose a Construction 
3. Prove that breaking Construction under Threat Model will solve an underlying hard problem (e.g. factoring integers)

Symmetric Ciphers: Both sides use the same key (e.g. substitution cipher, Caesar cipher (shift letters by n))
Key space: The set of all possible keys that can be used to generate a key, e.g. for 26 letter substitution cipher would be 26!
Cipher Text or CT attacks utilize only the cipher text to solve. Example of CT techniques to break Substitution Ciphers:
  1. Single character frequency: compare CT with stats for standard english usage, i.e. 12.7% E, 9.1% T, and 8.1% A 
  2. Digram frequency : compare digram (letter pairs) frequency of commonly used pairs, i.e. 'he', 'an', 'in', and 'th'
  
Vigener Cipher: Use a Key to add to CT and compute modular of each character to obtain ET. Example:
                       Key= LEAHWLEAHWLE
                       CT=  MYSECRETTEXT
                       ET=  YDTMZDJUBBJY
